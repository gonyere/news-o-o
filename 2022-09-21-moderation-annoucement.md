Today we are proud to announce the [openSUSE Moderation Team](https://en.opensuse.org/Moderation), which will henceforth be the central point of contact for all of openSUSE Moderation and conflict resolution, as well as any code of conduct violations from across all of openSUSE platforms.

The reasoning behind the Moderation Team, is to take future actions is and to to establish and implement comparable mechanisms in moderation equally across platforms. This will allow for a more consistent and transparent methodology,
with a similar framework of moderation practices and fundamental set of rules across all our platforms. Thus, in the future warns, kicks, temporary and longtime bans, etc will be more uniform in their nature.

The goal of the Moderation Team is to create a safe environment for everyone in the openSUSE Community on all platforms and to ensure that the [openSUSE Guiding Principals](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Guiding_principles) and [openSUSE Code of Conduct](https://en.opensuse.org/Code_of_Conduct) are upheld. The Moderation Team will take action in the case of similar violations.

The Moderation Team is composed of representatives from within the openSUSE [Communication](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Communication_channels), [Forums](https://forums.opensuse.org/forum.php) and [Social Media platforms](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Social_media_contacts). The goal is to have a designated person who represents Moderators from each platform at every meeting.
