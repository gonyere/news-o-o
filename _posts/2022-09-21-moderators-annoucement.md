Today we are proud to announce the [openSUSE Moderation Team](https://en.opensuse.org/Moderation), which will henceforth be the central point of contact for all of openSUSE Moderation and conflict resolution, as well as any code of conduct violations from across all of openSUSE platforms.

The reasoning for the Moderation Team to take future actions is to help resolve conflicts in an open and transparent manner to the extent that is acceptable for all parties involved. By doing this, the team will be able to establish and implement comparable mechanisms to moderation equally across platforms. The purpose of being transparent will allow for correspondence among the community on whether the actions were appropriate and for the openSUSE Board to focus on other tasks.

The result will be a framework of moderation practices across all our platforms, resulting in every platform sharing a fundamental set of rules. Thus, in the future warns, kicks, temporary and longtime bans, etc will be more uniform across platforms.

The goal of the Moderation Team is to create a safe environment for everyone in the openSUSE Community on all platforms and to ensure that the [openSUSE Guiding Principals](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Guiding_principles) and [openSUSE Code of Conduct](https://en.opensuse.org/Code_of_Conduct) are upheld. The Moderation Team will take action in the case of similar violations.

The Moderation Team is composed of representatives from within the openSUSE [Communication](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Communication_channels), [Forums](https://forums.opensuse.org/forum.php) and [Social Media platforms](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Social_media_contacts). The goal is to have a designated person who represents Moderators from each platform at every meeting.
